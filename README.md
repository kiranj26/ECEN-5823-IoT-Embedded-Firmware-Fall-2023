# ECEN 5823: IoT Embedded Firmware - Fall 2023

## Course Overview
This repository contains my work and notes from the ECEN 5823 IoT Embedded Firmware course, conducted at the University of Colorado in the Fall of 2023. The course focused on the development of firmware for low-energy, internet-connected embedded systems, aligning with contemporary industry trends.

## Topics Covered
Throughout the course, we delved into various aspects of IoT firmware development, including:
- Embedded System Architecture and Design Principles
- Firmware Programming for IoT Devices
- Implementation of IoT Communication Protocols (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread)
- Event-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems
- IoT Security and Privacy Considerations
- Energy Management in IoT Devices

## Final Project: Gesture-Enabled Interactive Classroom Display System
### Overview
The "Gesture-Enabled Interactive Classroom Display System," my final project for the course, showcases an innovative application of IoT technologies in education. This system uses gesture and motion sensor technologies to create a more interactive and engaging classroom environment. Through the use of an APDS-9960 sensor, the system allows instructors and students to interact with digital content seamlessly. Additionally, a PIR motion sensor is integrated for efficient energy management, adapting the classroom's energy use based on occupancy and activity.
